### - Steps (on linux):
    1- Before you open up the Docker daemon, you must first shut the running one down.
       How you do this will vary depending on your operating system.
       If youâ€™re not sure how to do this, you can first try this command.

       - sudo su - (connect as root user)
       - service docker stop
       or systemctl stop docker
       - ps -ef | grep -E 'docker (-d|daemon)\b' | grep -v grep
       - dockerd -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375
       - service docker start (disable open access to daemon and start docker locally)
    + This command starts docker as a daemon (dockerdaemon), defines the host server with the -H flag,
      uses the TCP protocol, opens up to all IP addresses (with 0.0.0.0), and opens on the standard Docker server port (2375).

    :USE IP RESTRICTIONS If you open your daemon up, be sure to open up to a specific IP range only, and not to 0.0.0.0, which is highly insecure!
